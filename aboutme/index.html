    <h2>Richard Ololade Olawepo</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Richard Ololade Olawepo but everyone just calls me Ritchie. Originally, I'm from Kwara, Nigeria but I currently live in Lagos.</p>
    <p>I love listening to music, watching movies, singing and dancing (I kinda suck at both by the way), playing video games, travelling and reading way too much spy novels.</p>
    <p>I currently work as a Realtor and I love my job but I'm always looking for new opportunities to improve myself and grow.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for all my life and every passing day, my testimony of the Savior and the love He has for me just keeps growing. I served in the Nigeria Enugu Mission between 2016 and 2018 and those were like the best two years of my life.</p>
    <p>I honestly look forward to learning with and from all of you.</p>
